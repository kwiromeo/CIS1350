                <h3>About this Site</h3> 
                <p> This site has been developed as a final project for CIS 1350 - Intro to HTML & CSS at Sinclair community college. It is developed using bare HTML and CSS, and the smallest drop of vanilla JS (No bootstrap, no jquery).

                <img src="../FinalProject/images/rk_headshot_400x400.jpg">
                <p>Hi, I am Romeo Kwihangana, the author of this project.</p>
                <p>This year I am pursuing a short term web developer certificate at Sinclair Community College. Professionally, I am trying to expand my skills and add web development to my electrical engineering background. I've been fascinated with web development and this is the first year I get to explore this interest seriously.</p>
                <p>I have previously programmed. I took C++ was 7 years ago as part of my undergraduate studies. I can get around MATLAB (mathematical software) well, and I've taken introductory online Python courses, and still do whenever I can.</p>
                <p>In my spare time, I am complete some small house improvement projects (I recently made a small bookshelf), and patched dry wall. Aside from small projects around the house, I also lift weights regularly, and I hope to run a few races this year.</p>
